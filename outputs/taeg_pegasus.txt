– It's not your usual story of a rich woman pouring perfume on a poor man, but that's exactly what happened to Jesus, according to the Bible. In the Gospel of Matthew, a woman broke a jar of perfume and poured it on the head of Jesus while he was reclining at a table. His disciples were indignant, asking, "Why this waste of perfume? It could have been sold for more than a year's wages and the money given to the poor." But Jesus said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to me. The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have me. When she poured this perfume on my body, she.
– The New York Times revisits the story of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection, as told in the Gospel of John, and finds that it's a tale of two faiths—one Jewish, one Christian. In the Gospel of John, Jesus is said to have been resurrected from the dead from the grave of Lazarus, a son of God who had been killed by the powers of the king David. The Jewish faith is that Jesus was the son of God. The Christian faith is that he was the son of God. In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus is said to have been raised from the dead from the grave by the Jewish people. The Jewish faith is that Jesus was the son of God. The Christian faith is that he was.
– It's not every day that you get the chance to meet Jesus Christ, but that's exactly what happened to me when I went to see him for the first time at the Wailing Wall in Palm Beach, Fla., on Sunday. As I approached the Wailing Wall, a young man in a baseball cap approached me and said, "Hi, this is Jesus Christ." I turned to him and said, "Good morning, Lord." The young man looked at me and said, "Good morning, Lord." I turned to him and said, "This is Jesus Christ. He is the Son of God, the Messiah, the King of Israel." The man looked at me and said, "Good morning, Lord.
– It's the story of a donkey and a cloak, followed by a king who sits on a donkey's colt, and it's a story that's been told before, but it's getting new attention thanks to a pastor who's written about it in his book. "The Lord needs it," says the headline on the New Testament account of the donkey's appearance on the Mount of Olives, as quoted in the Los Angeles Times. In the book of Matthew, Jesus is quoted as saying to his followers, "Go to the village ahead of you, and at once you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me. If anyone says.
– The Vatican today issued a warning to members of the Catholic Church, saying that while it is true that some Catholics are straying from the church's teachings, it is "in no way reflective of the attitude of the church as a whole," the AP reports. In a statement, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith said that while some Catholics are following the church's teachings, "the attitude of the church as a whole is not in conformity with them." The church, the statement said, is "deeply troubled by the decline in the number of Catholics who are following the church's teachings."
– As the world watches to see how President Trump's tariff fight with China plays out, the Washington Post takes a look at what it calls the "elephant in the room": the US-China trade deficit. Trump has said he wants to reduce the trade deficit to zero by the end of his presidency, but some economists say that's a tough sell given China's growing economic clout. "I don't think it's a stretch to say that we're going to have a trade war in the very near future," says one economist. "We're going to have a lot of tit-for-tat," adds another. "It's going to be very hard to get a deal done."
– The New York Times is out with a correction to an old story about Jesus, and it's a doozy. The original account of the Gospel of Matthew says that when Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, "Who is this?" The crowds answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." The Times explains that the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word. Many people, because they had heard that he had given this miraculous sign, went out to meet him. So the Pharisees said to one another, "See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!"
– The New York Times is out with a correction to a story about Jesus that first appeared in the Sunday newspaper. The original story says that Jesus entered Jerusalem and went to the temple. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve. The Times has corrected the story to say that Jesus entered Jerusalem and went to the temple. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.
– It's the story of a hungry Jesus who found nothing but leaves from a fig tree. He then tells his disciples, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again." The story is from the Gospel of John, but it's worth noting that it's not the first time Jesus has made such a statement, notes the Los Angeles Times: In the Sermon on the Mount, he says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." (It's not clear if the Sermon on the Mount was translated as "kill the fig" or "get rid of the fig.").
– It's a story that's familiar to anyone who's ever set foot in a Christian church—and it's one that's been repeated over and over again. In the Bible, Jesus is said to have recounted this to a group of men who were selling doves: "Is it not written: 'My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations'? But you have made it 'a den of robbers.'" So he drove them out. "It is written," he said to them, "'My house will be a house of prayer'; but you have made it 'a den of robbers.'" As he taught them, he continued, "'My house will be called a house.
– It's a tale of self-doubt, self-doubt, and self-doubt that's been told before, but it's one that's been told again and again. It's the story of a man who says he's the son of a demon, and it's a tale of self-doubt that's been told again and again. This time, it's the story of a man who says he's the son of a demon, and it's a tale of self-doubt that's been told again and again. This time, it's the story of a man who says he's the son of a demon, and it's a tale of.
– The New York Times has a fascinating look at the life of Jesus, from his early days as a Roman Catholic to his time as a Protestant minister. The story begins with a series of miracles that Jesus performed on the blind and lame, and it continues with the story of a group of Jewish children who were so incensed by his actions that they began shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David." When the chief priests and teachers of the law saw what the children were saying, they were indignant. "Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," replied Jesus, "have you never read, 'From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise.'"
– It's the kind of story you don't see every day—a woman walking her dog in the middle of the street, only to be stopped by a cop. It's not every day that the dog gets pulled over. But it's not every day that the dog gets pulled over for not wearing a seat belt. And it's not every day that the dog gets pulled over for not having a seat belt on.

– It's not the kind of story you'd expect to see in the pages of a children's book, but that's exactly what's happened in the case of "Charlotte's Web," a retelling of the story of the baby who was born to Mary and Joseph in the Gospel of Matthew. The New York Daily News reports that the story, which was first told in the Gospel of Luke, is based on the words of Matthew 25:14, "And when they were coming to me in the Lord, they said to me, 'My God, why have you forsaken me?'" The baby was born to Mary and Joseph in the Gospel of Matthew, and it's believed that the first-century.
– The story of Jesus' crucifixion is one of the most well-known stories in Christian history, and it's a story that's getting a lot of attention these days, thanks to a New York Times op-ed by Rich Lowry, who argues that it's time for Christians to stop being so "sanctimonious" about the death and resurrection of their own ancestors. Lowry argues that the Bible is "riddled with holes" that make it difficult for Christians to understand what really happened to Jesus. He lays out a number of reasons why that is, including the fact that Jesus' followers didn't follow his instructions, didn't follow his commands, and didn't follow his example. "It's.
– It's not every day that a Christian website goes on the offensive against Mormons, but that's exactly what's happening in Utah. The Salt Lake Tribune reports on a "relentless" campaign on Facebook and Twitter by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which is trying to get its message out to as many people as it can. "We're not here to attack Mormons," says the head of the church's social media department. "We're here to proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ." The anti-Mormon campaign isn't just about Facebook and Twitter, it's about reaching out to people in other faiths, too. "If you're.
– The story of a father who demanded his sons work in a vineyard is recounted in the Bible, but it's the account of a son who didn't follow his father's lead that's drawing the most attention. The son's father had asked both of his sons to work in the vineyard, but the son who answered first changed his mind and went, while the son who answered second time around didn't follow his father's lead. "What do you think?" asked Jesus. "There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work today in the vineyard.' 'I will not,' he answered, but later he changed his mind.
– "May this never be!" That's how the Christian Science Monitor sums up a story from the Bible about a man's decision to send his son to live with tenants in his vineyard. But when the tenants saw the son, they decided to kill him for his inheritance. "Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?" the story's author asks. "And he will rent the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time." The tenants' response: "He will bring those wretches to a wretched end, and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time.
– It's not every day that you get the chance to go to the movies with your kids, but that's exactly what happens when your kids get the chance to go to the movies with you. That's why it's so important for parents to make sure their kids read the script before they head out the door, because if they don't, the consequences can be deadly serious. That's why it's so important for parents to make sure their kids read the script before they head out the door, because if they don't, the consequences can be deadly serious. That's why it's so important for parents to make sure their kids read the script before they head out the door.
– When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parable, they knew he was talking about them. They looked for a way to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd because the people held that he was a prophet. Then they looked for a way to arrest him because they knew he had spoken the parable against them. But they were afraid of the crowd; so they left him and went away. The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people. But they were afraid of the people.
– When it comes to the Christian faith, the belief that Jesus Christ is the son of God and the only one who can save you from your sins, it's easy to see why some people don't believe in him—but it's also easy to see why some people don't believe in him at all. That's according to a new Gallup poll that finds most Americans don't believe in Jesus Christ as their personal savior, despite the fact that he's the only one who can save them from their sins. In Gallup's latest poll, 51% of Americans say they believe Jesus Christ is the only one who can save them, compared to 42% who say they don't believe in him, and.
– When it comes to the Catholic Church, there's a lot of finger-pointing going on, and a lot of finger-pointing happening right now. The latest to make headlines is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which this week announced that it will hold an "apostolic visitation" to mark the crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ, reports the Salt Lake Tribune. The church had previously announced that it would hold an "apostolic visitation" to mark the death of Jesus Christ on Easter Sunday, but now it's changing that to mark the crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ on the third day of the fourth week of the fourth month. The reason for the shift is a bit unclear, but it's.
– If you're looking for proof that Jesus Christ is still alive, look no further than the story of the seven brothers who "were married to her" at the time of their death, according to the New York Times' retelling of the story. "At the resurrection, people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven," Jesus said. "When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven." The Times' retelling of the story is based on the book of Deuteronomy, which says that "if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and have children for him." The seven brothers were all married.
– When Jesus was asked which of the commandments was the greatest in the law, he answered, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind." One of the teachers of the law asked him, "Of all the commandments, which is the most important?" He replied, "The most important one is this: 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.'" The man replied, "Well said, teacher. You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him. To love him with all your heart.
– The New York Times is out with a story about Jesus that's getting a lot of attention: It's about the son of David. In the story, Jesus asks the Pharisees, "What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?" They reply: "The son of David. For he says, 'The Lord said to my Lord: 'Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.' If then David calls him 'Lord,' how can he be his son?" The Times says it's based on an account in the book of Psalms, in which David declares: "The Lord said to my Lord: 'Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool.
– When it comes to the Christian faith, the belief that Jesus Christ is the Son of God has been held up as a model for generations of Christians—and it's a model that's being called into question by some Christian leaders, the Los Angeles Times reports. According to the Christian Science Monitor, there's a "slippery slope" in the belief that Jesus Christ is a "Messiah" who's "the head of the church." Some Christians believe he's a divisive figure who needs to be reined in, while others see him as a divisive figure who should be allowed to grow in his role as the church's leader. Others see him as a divisive figure who needs to be reined.
– The Vatican's official line on homosexuality is that it's "morally wrong" and "against the law," but some members of the Catholic Church have taken it to a whole new level. In an open letter to the Vatican's secretary of state, Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, more than 100 cardinals and other church leaders say that homosexuality is "incompatible" with the church's "core values," the AP reports. The letter, published in the International Business Times and obtained by the AP, was signed by more than 100 cardinals and is believed to be the first such letter to be published by a major Catholic newspaper. The letter is believed to be part of a major revision of the church's.
– President Trump's tariff fight with China appears to be only getting nastier. A Wall Street Journal analysis finds that Trump's tariff fight with China has already cost the US about $200 million in lost trade this year, and that number could go up even more if China retaliates against US tariffs on steel and aluminum, which Trump has threatened to slap on top of tariffs on goods from China. The analysis also finds that Trump's proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum could cost the US about $200 million more in lost trade this year, and that if China retaliates against the US, the US could lose about $200 million in trade. Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on up to half of China's products if it doesn't.
– When it comes to the importance of giving back to the community that's given so much to you, there's no better place than the aisles of your local Walmart. That's because, as the Christian Post points out, Walmart is one of the largest single Givers of Free Stuff in the world. In fact, it was one of the first Walmarts to donate to the Boy Scouts of America—in fact, it was one of the first Walmarts to donate to the Boy Scouts of America's first national conference. And it's one of the first Walmarts to donate to the Boy Scouts of America's second national conference, which was held last month. It's no wonder, then, that.
– The New York Times has a fascinating piece on the final days of Jesus' life, in which he is said to have been walking away from a temple when his disciples came up to him. "Do you see all these things?" he asked. "I tell you the truth, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down." As he was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Look, Teacher! What massive stones! What magnificent buildings!" "Do you see all these great buildings?" replied Jesus. "Not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down." Some of his disciples were remarking about how the temple was adorned with beautiful stones.
– "When will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are all about to be fulfilled?" That's what Jesus' disciples asked him as he sat on the Mount of Olives, according to the Gospel of John. The disciples asked him privately, "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are all about to be fulfilled?" Jesus replied: "Teacher, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place?" The disciples believed him and continued to ask him, "When will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?" (Read the full Gospel here.).
– It's not the kind of headline you'd expect to see in a newspaper, but that's exactly what happened in the case of a South Carolina woman who got fired from her job as a special education teacher for refusing to take a lie-detector test, the Charlotte Observer reports. Police say 46-year-old Kimberly Stinnett was let go after refusing to take a test that would have given her a criminal record. She had worked as a special education teacher for more than 20 years and had been with the Greenville County school system for more than a decade. Stinnett says she quit her job because she didn't want to be a "distraction" for the district and because she didn't.
– When the Bible is read today, it's not in its original form, but the New York Times has pulled together some of its favorite passages to give us a taste of what's to come. Among the highlights: James 1:19-20: "When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of birth pains." John 12:33: "Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. At that time many will turn away.
– President Trump's tariff war with China isn't just bad for the US: It's bad for China, too, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of tariffs Trump imposed on Chinese goods over the weekend. The Journal says Trump's move was in response to China's decision to retaliate against US tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cotton. Trump said the tariffs were necessary because of China's "theft of intellectual property" and its "theft of trade secrets." He said the move was necessary to prevent a trade war between the US and China, which he said was "imminent." The Journal notes that Trump's tariff war with China isn't the first time the US has struck a trade deal.
– President Trump's tariff fight with China appears to be only getting nastier. A Wall Street Journal analysis finds that Trump's tariff fight with China has already cost the US about $200 million in lost trade this year, and that number could go up even more if China retaliates with tariffs on US goods. The analysis also finds that Trump's tariff fight with China has cost the US about $200 million in lost trade this year, and that number could go up even more if China retaliates with tariffs on US goods.

– If the sight of a dead body makes you feel sad, you're not alone. The Los Angeles Times reports that more than a dozen dead bodies have been found in and around Los Angeles over the past few days. The Times says it's unclear if the bodies are connected to recent high-profile deaths, including that of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and Sandra Bland. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department says it's looking into the possibility that the bodies are connected to recent deaths, but it hasn't confirmed that.
– In the wake of the Orlando shooting, the nation is taking a fresh look at gun control—and at gun laws. Here are five things you need to know about gun control in America, courtesy of the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Wall Street Journal, and the National Conference of State Legislatures: President Trump's support for gun-control measures isn't sitting well with most Americans, according to a recent Gallup poll. More than 75% of Americans say gun control is "inadequate" or "not at all safe," and more than 90% say gun violence is on the rise. But even if you don't agree with the president's policies, you should still make sure you read the NRA's annual convention speech.
– It's the story of a fig tree and its leaves: "Look at the fig tree and all the trees. When they sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near. Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that the kingdom of God is near." That's what Jesus told his followers in the Gospel of John, reports the Los Angeles Times. Today's version of the story, however, includes a twist: It's about a baby Jesus who's about to be born to a virgin, reports the New York Times. The baby will be called Matthew, and the story is about him being "baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." (.
– "No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father." That's the message from a New York Times Magazine cover story that's getting a lot of attention this week. The cover story is on a piece by David Remnick in the New Yorker, and Remnick's take is that it's "a scathing indictment of the nation's political leaders"—and of President Trump in particular. Remnick's take: "We're in the midst of a president who's not only trying to crush the opposition, but who's also trying to crush the conservative movement." Trump, he writes, "is not only trying to.
– In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. "As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away." That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man, writes.
– "Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left." That's what the Bible says about the coming of Jesus Christ, and it's a line that's getting a lot of attention in the wake of this weekend's shooting at a church in Charleston, W.Va., reports the Richmond Times-Dispatch. Police say the shooter, who hasn't been identified, opened fire at the First Baptist Church around 7pm Saturday, killing one person and wounding at least five others. A pastor at the church tells the newspaper that the shooting is "unbelievable." He says the.
– If you've ever wondered what it's like to live under the shadow of Jesus Christ, you're in good company. The Bible says that when the Son of Man comes, he'll "come at an hour when you do not expect him," and those who don't prepare will be doomed, the Telegraph reports. "Be careful, or your hearts will be weighed down with dissipation, drunkenness, and the anxieties of life, and that day will close on you unexpectedly like a trap," says the Gospel of John. "For it will come upon all those who live on the face of the whole earth. Be always on the watch, and pray that you may be able to escape all that is about to happen.
– The story of the 10 virgins who stood in front of the bridegroom at midnight is a tale of mistaken identity, according to the Christian Science Monitor. It's based on the Bible's account of a group of people who went to meet a bridegroom only to discover he was a long time coming. The Monitor's translation: "At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like 10 virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish and five were wise. The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them. The wise, however, took oil in jars along with their lamps. The bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and.
– President Trump's tariff war with China isn't just hurting the US economy—it's endangering American jobs, too, reports the Wall Street Journal. The White House says Trump's tariffs on $200 billion in goods and services will take a toll on the US economy over the next few months, though the newspaper notes that the president hasn't yet made up his mind on what he'll do. "We're going to have to get used to it," says a top economic adviser to the president. "It's going to be a tough couple of months." The White House says Trump's move isn't tied to China's retaliation against US tariffs on $200 billion in goods and services,.
– "When did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?" That's one of the questions Jesus asks in the Gospel of John, but it's not the one that's getting the most attention. Rather, it's the one that follows: "For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me," writes the Rev. Frank Schaefer of the First Baptist.
– It's a story that's been told before, but it's getting new attention thanks to a New York Times analysis of some of the Bible's most memorable quotes. The story begins with a group of Greeks who went to Galilee to worship at the Feast of the Messiah, and they asked Jesus if he would be there. "Sir," they said, "we would like to see Jesus." Jesus' reply: "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. The man who loves his life will lose it, while the.
– It's a tale straight out of a spy thriller, or at least the kind you don't see every day: A man dressed as a 19th-century British soldier gets into an argument with a woman in a crowd outside a London pub, and the argument turns violent. The man throws the woman to the ground and kicks her in the stomach. She crumples to the ground, and the man, dressed as a soldier, kicks her in the stomach again. The argument continues, and this time the woman kicks the man in the stomach. He then throws the woman to the ground and again kicks her in the stomach. She crumples again and this time the man hits her in the stomach again. The woman.

– The story of how Jesus was arrested, tortured, and killed—it's a tale for the ages, but it's getting a lot of attention now that it's made its way to the front pages of major newspapers. The New York Times takes a look at the tale in the Gospel of John, which begins, "Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas, and they plotted to arrest Jesus in some sly way and kill him. But not during the Feast," they said, "or there may be a riot among the people." (The story is told in the Gospel of John, but the Times says it's based on.
– The story of Jesus' betrayal by Judas Iscariot gets stranger still. In the Gospel of Luke, Judas is said to have betrayed Jesus to the leaders of the Jewish temple. They promised to give him money, but when Judas went to the chief priests to betray Jesus, they were "delighted and agreed to give him money," according to the Gospel of Matthew. But when Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard to discuss his plan, Satan entered him. "Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus," the Gospel of Matthew reads. "They were delighted and agreed to give him money. He consented, and watched for.
– The New York Times is out with a look at the life and ministry of Jesus Christ, and it's no surprise that the subject is religion. The story begins with a look at the life and ministry of Jesus, as told in the New York Times Magazine. Here's a sample of some of the key quotes: "For they loved praise from men more than praise from God. But because of the Pharisees they would not confess their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue; for they loved praise from men more than praise from God." "But because of the Pharisees they would not confess their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue; for they loved praise from men more than praise from God."
– At the end of the Gospel of John's second reading, Jesus says this: "When a man believes in me, he does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me. When he looks at me, he sees the one who sent me. I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness." That's a reference to the man who says, "I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness." The reading was taken from the New International Version, notes the AP, and it's part of the John Paul II biographer's series on the "mystery of the.

– It's that time of year again: time for us to reflect on the story of the Passover and its importance to Christians. The story begins on the first day of the week of Unleavened Bread, and it's a story of preparation, according to the Christian Science Monitor. "On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus' disciples asked him, 'Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?'

It's about how the son of God—whom the Times describes as a "prominent Roman Catholic"—flew from Jerusalem to a remote village in Galilee, where he was greeted by a crowd of people from all over the world. The Times says it's "one of the most significant eyewitness accounts of a religious event in modern history." The story is based on the Gospel of John, which says that when the crowds gathered at the Wailing Wall, Jesus was among them.

– The story of how Abraham Lincoln ate his first Passover with the Jewish people is a fascinating one, and it's one that's getting a lot of attention now that the White House has acknowledged it. The White House says that Lincoln ate his first Passover with the Jewish people, and that he told them, "I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God." The White House says that's because Lincoln wanted to be sure that the Passover he ate with the Jewish people "wasn't just a one-time thing." The White House says that Lincoln ate his first Passover with the Jewish people because he wanted to be sure that the holiday "was not just a one-.
– The story of Jesus washing his disciples' feet is one of the most famous in the Bible, and it's a story that's getting a lot of attention this week as the Catholic Church gets ready to celebrate Easter, the AP reports. The New York Times has the story in its headline, while the Washington Post has it in its headline, along with a photo of Jesus washing his disciples' feet with a towel wrapped around his waist. The story is based on the Gospel of John, which says that after Jesus had finished eating, he went back to his disciples and washed their feet. "Do you understand what I have done for you?" he asked them. "You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and.
– It's a story that's been told before, but it's getting new attention thanks to a New York Times op-ed by an ex-journalist, and it's a story that's getting a lot of attention because of it. It's from the Gospel of John, and it begins: "And while they were eating, he said, 'I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me.' While they were reclining at the table eating, he said, 'I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me—one who is eating with me.' But the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table. The Son of Man will.
– It's a story of betrayal that's familiar to anyone who's ever dipped a bowl with Jesus, and it's one that's been repeated over and over again in the Bible. But what's new is that it's told in a way that includes the word "betray," reports the Los Angeles Times. In the Gospel of John, Jesus' followers recall that one of them dipped his hand into a bowl with him, and Jesus replied, "The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me. The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if.
– Jesus gave Judas Iscariot a piece of bread—and then Satan entered into him. That's according to the New York Times' retelling of the story of the disciples' encounter with the devil. The disciples were in a room when Jesus said to them, "It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish." He then dipped the bread in a dish and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon. As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him.
– "What you are about to do, do quickly." That's what Jesus said to Judas Isidore as the betrayer at a meal—and it's a line that's getting a lot of attention today, thanks to a New York Times piece by Maureen Dowd. The story begins with a meal at the Wailing Wall, where Jesus is said to have told the crowd, "What you are about to do, do quickly." (It's not clear why he said that, but the story goes that Judas had been given the money to pay for the meal, so he was supposed to "do quickly.") As the meal was about to begin, however, the words of Jesus got lost in the.
– As the world watches to see how President Trump's tariff fight with China plays out, the Washington Post takes a look at what it calls the "upshot" of Trump's tariff fight with China—and at what it calls the "upshot" for Christians. If you're not sure what "upshot" to take, it's this: If the US slaps tariffs on Chinese goods, China will retaliate by cutting off its imports of US goods. And if the US doesn't do that, China will retaliate by cutting off its own imports of US goods, too. In other words, if the US slaps tariffs on Chinese goods, China will retaliate by cutting off its own imports of US goods.
– It's a story that's been told before, but it's getting new attention now that it's the subject of an HBO documentary. HBO's Jesus: The Story tells the story of how the son of God—whom the Bible says was a "high priest" and a "high-ranking official" in the Roman Catholic Church—flew to a small town in Galilee, where he was greeted by a crowd of enthusiastic young men. One of the first people to greet him was a woman who said, "You're the Messiah, Lord." The crowd cheered, and the crowd shouted, "This is my body, give it to us! This is my body given for you, do this.
– The story of Jesus Christ's first public appearance is one of the most famous in Christian history, and it's a story that's getting a lot of attention these days. The New York Times revisits the story of the first time the Messiah appeared in public, in the Gospel of John. The story begins with a group of young men, all of whom were in their late teens or early 20s, sitting around a large table. One of the men brought a cup, and Jesus took it from them and said, "Drink from it, all of you. This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins." He then took the cup and gave thanks and offered it.
– The story of Jesus Christ's crucifixion and death is a well-known one, but it's a little less well-known that the man who says it all was a lie. In the Gospel of John, Jesus says, "I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father's kingdom." But that's not exactly what he did, according to the New York Times. Instead, he said, "I tell you the truth, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God." In other words, he didn't drink until he was about to die.
– The story of the Battle of Thermopylae is one of the most famous battles of all time—and now it's being told in a new movie, Fox News reports. In the first part of the story, the Thermopylae soldiers fought the Philistines, who were trying to take over the land of Israel. The Philistines eventually defeated them, and Jesus tells the story to the soldiers: "The kings of the Philistines lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors. But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves. For who is greater, the one who is at.

– It's not every day that the world's most famous Roman Catholic is on the same page with the Vatican, but that's exactly what's happening in the case of Pope Francis. The pontiff, who's been the target of anti-abortion and pro-gay-marriage sentiments in the past, issued a letter this week to Catholics around the world, urging them not to let their "hearts be troubled" and urging them to "trust in God," the AP reports. The letter was posted on the website of the Vatican's Office for the Evangelii Gaudium, or "the office of the Lord Jesus Christ," and it comes a week after a similar letter was posted on the website of.
– The Vatican's top official for relations with the Catholic Church has resigned in the wake of a sex-abuse scandal involving one of his employees, reports the AP. A spokesman for Father Gianfranco Ravasi said Sunday that he has resigned effective immediately. The scandal first came to light when an employee of the church's office in Rome got drunk and passed out in the office's parking lot. Afterward, he told police and church officials that he'd had sex with a church worker. The employee was arrested and charged with criminal sexual conduct. The church's secretary of state, Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, said in a statement that the sex-abuse scandal is a "matter of deep concern" for the church.
– When Jesus was about 20 years old, his parents sent him to live with his grandparents in the desert because they couldn't afford to send him there permanently. But now that he's been raised in a Christian home, they've decided to send him back to the Middle East—and they're offering a hefty price for his freedom, the Telegraph reports. "If you don't have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one," he told his followers. "It is written: 'And he was numbered with the transgressors'; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is.
– "Come now; let us leave." That's what Jesus said to his followers as they went out to the Mount of Olives to worship on Sunday, the New York Times reports. The disciples were following him when he said, "Come now; let us leave." The Aramaic words for "leave" and "go" come from the Greek for "to go" and "to stay," and the Greek word for "to leave" comes from the Greek for "to stay." The Times notes that the phrase "to leave" refers to the way Jesus walked with his followers, while the word for "to stay" refers to his disciples following him.
– The story of how Jesus' disciples first came to believe that he is the Son of God is a fascinating one, and the New York Times has a nice explainer on it. The key quote: "This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee." Peter: "Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will." Jesus: "I tell you the truth, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times." But Peter: "Even if I have to die with you.
– The story of Mary Magdalene and Jesus Christ is one of the most famous in Christian history, and it's about to get even more famous. The New York Times has dug up a portion of the Gospel of Matthew, which is believed to have been written by Mary Magdalene herself. The Times says it's the first time a well-known biblical story has been retold in a movie or TV show. In this case, it's a remake of the 1976 Billy Bob Thornton film of the same name, which tells the story of Mary Magdalene's relationship with Jesus. The Times says the original version of the Gospel was written by Mary Magdalene's husband, Joseph, and the new version is based on his daughter's account.
– The Vatican's top official for relations with the Holy See has resigned in the wake of a sex-abuse scandal that tarnished the reputation of one of the world's most high-profile cardinals, the AP reports. Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi resigned Wednesday, a day after the Vatican announced that it was investigating allegations that he sexually abused minors at a children's home in the 1970s and '80s. In a letter to the Vatican's secretary of state, Ravasi said he was stepping down because of the "scandal" and because of the "scandal and the damage it has caused to the image of the Holy See." He said he had prayed about it for a long time, but had not yet.
– President Trump's tariff war with China appears to have hit a dead end, at least in terms of US-China relations, reports the Wall Street Journal. A White House official tells the Journal that Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have agreed that Trump's proposed tariffs on goods from China will be lower than those currently in place. The official says Trump will make the announcement at a meeting of G7 leaders later this month, though it's not clear whether the meeting will take place in person or over the phone. The White House says Trump has been in touch with Chinese officials, though the Journal's sources say Trump has not yet spoken with Xi. The White House says Trump has not yet decided whether to retaliate against China.

"Though I have been speaking figuratively, a time is coming when I will no longer use this kind of language but will tell you plainly about my Father," he says. "In that day you will ask in my name. I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf. No, the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have.
– As the world mourns the death of 27-year-old college student Mollie Tibbetts, who vanished on her way to her internship in Iowa last month, some are asking: Why did Tibbetts' family file a missing-person report? A family friend tells the Des Moines Register that " Mollie's family has been looking into her disappearance for some time. They've been trying to find her, trying to contact her, trying to reach out to her," but they haven't been able to get through to her. "It's not something we've been able to do for some time," the friend says. "It's something we've been trying to do for a long time." The.
– When it comes to the Bible, the Old and New Testaments are one and the same, but in the New Testament, there's a big difference. In the Gospel of John, Jesus recounts a series of events that took place in the days before his crucifixion. Here are some highlights from the story, which is believed to have been written by someone else: The story: When Jesus was about to die, his followers went to a place called Gethsemane to pray. "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death," he said to them. "Stay here and keep watch with me." They reached the place, and he told them, "Pray that you will not fall into temptation." The story:.
– The story of Jesus is a tale of suffering, but it's also a tale of triumph. The New York Times today takes a look at the final hours of Jesus' life in the Gospel of John, recounting how, as he was dying on the cross, an angel appeared to him and said, "Abba, Father, everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will." He then took the cup from him and prayed, "Abba, Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will." When he had finished praying, he found his disciples asleep, exhausted from his sorrow.
– It's a story about a group of disciples who fell asleep while studying, and it's a story about Jesus Christ himself. It's about a cup, and it's about temptation. It's about a king, and it's about a group of men who fell asleep while studying, and it's about a king, and it's about a group of women who fell asleep while studying, and it's about a king, and it's about a woman who fell asleep while studying, and it's about a king, and it's about a woman who fell asleep while studying, and it's about a king, and it's about a woman who fell asleep while.
– The story of Jesus Christ's first followers is a tale of betrayal, but it's also a tale of faith, reports the Los Angeles Times. In the Gospel of John, Jesus is said to have prayed with his disciples before they went into the desert. When he came back, he found them sleeping, and asked, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise, let us go! Here comes my betrayer!" The disciples didn't know what to say to him, so he prayed again. This time he found them sleeping again because their eyes were heavy. He said, "Are you still sleeping and resting?
– Judas Isidore, the betrayer of Jesus, is getting a fresh look thanks to a new documentary that's drawing attention to the Roman Catholic's role in the downfall of the Messiah, the AP reports. The film, called The Judas Isidore Story, tells the story of the betrayer's fateful kiss with Jesus, which led to his death on the cross. The original account of the kiss, in the Gospel of John, tells of a crowd of men coming to Jesus' side armed with clubs and swords. "The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard," Judas told them. Jesus replied, "Friend, do what you came for." The Judas I.
– The story of the disciples' encounter with Jesus is recounted in the Bible's New International Version, and it's a doozy. The disciples were about to approach him when he asked them, "Who is it you want?" "Jesus of Nazareth," they replied. "I am he." When he said, "I am he," they drew back and fell to the ground. Again he asked them, "Who is it you want?" And they said, "Jesus of Nazareth." "I told you that I am he," Jesus answered. "If you are looking for me, then let these men go." This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled: "I have not lost one of those you.
– When Jesus was arrested, one of his followers struck a high priest's servant with a sword, cutting off his ear. But when Jesus' followers saw what was going to happen, they said, "Lord, should we strike with our swords?" And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. But Jesus answered, "No more of this!" And he touched the man's ear and healed him. Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. (The servant's name was Malchus.) Jesus commanded Peter, "Put your sword away! Shall I not drink the cup the Father has.
– The New York Times has a piece on the life and ministry of Jesus Christ, and it includes this line from his very first sermon: "But this is your hour—when darkness reigns." It's a quote from the Gospel of John, and it's based on a New Testament account. The Times says it's a direct quote from the very first sermon, given to a crowd of followers at the Wailing Wall. It's not the first time it's been used in a Times piece, but it's the first time it's based on a New Testament account. (Read the Times piece in full here.) It's also the first time the Times has used the word "sermon.
– "Then all the disciples deserted him and fled. Then everyone deserted him and fled. Then the detachment of soldiers with its commander and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus. They bound him." That's how the New York Times begins its look at the story of Jesus' arrest in the Gospel of John, a tale it says "bears a striking resemblance" to today's events. The Times says it's based on an account of the story in the Gospel of Luke, in which Jesus is said to have been captured by a group of soldiers and then taken to the well of the well where he was to be buried. The soldiers reportedly tied him up and made him drink the well's liquid, which they then poured on.
– The story of how a young man who was following Jesus ended up naked and in jail is getting a lot of attention this week, thanks in part to a New York Times piece by Michael D. Shear. In it, he recounts a story from the Bible about a man who was following Jesus when he was taken into custody. The young man was wearing nothing but a linen garment, and when police seized him, he fled naked, leaving his garment behind. Shear recounts how the man was led to a cell, where he was beaten and had his clothes burned with a hot iron. He then told police, "I am following Jesus. I have no money. I have no clothes. I have no money. I have no life."
– The story of how Jesus was arrested and taken to Caiaphas, the high priest, is one of the most famous in Christian history, and it's a story that's getting a lot of attention now that it's been published in the New York Times. Here's how it went down: Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the chief priests, elders, and teachers of the law had assembled. They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, elders, and teachers of the law came together. Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest.

– The story of how Peter got into trouble with Jesus is a familiar one, but this time it's a little different.

Peter had been following Jesus and was about to enter the high priest's courtyard to see what would happen when he ran into a girl on duty. The girl spoke to the high priest, who brought Peter into the room. The high priest's son had been in trouble with the wife of one of his friends, and the high priest was angry. So he ordered the wife's son, David, to go into the room with him. But David didn't want to.
– The story of how Jesus' disciples came to know him is a fascinating one, and it's been told before—including by Mary Magdalene, who says that when she was about 20 years old, she and her brother went to see him for the first time. (The New York Times has a pretty convincing account of this happening in the Gospel of John.) But it's Peter's own account in the Gospel of Matthew that's getting the most attention, and it's one in which he denies having ever met Jesus. It's from the Gospel of Luke, and it recounts how one servant girl saw him and said to him, "You also were with Jesus of Galilee." Peter's response: "

– The story of Jesus' crucifixion continues to resonate, and this time it's from the Gospel of Luke. As the New York Times recounts, the high priest questioned him about his teaching. "I have spoken openly to the world," Jesus replied. "I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret. Why question me? Ask those who heard me. Surely they know what I said." The high priest then struck him in the face. "Is this the way you answer the high priest?" he asked. "If I said something wrong, Jesus replied, "testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me.
– It's a story that's been told before, but it's getting new attention thanks to an account in the Gospel of John.

The high priest said to him, "I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ, the Son.

– It's the story of one of the most famous denied claims of all time: When Jesus was about to die, a follower of him asked him, "You are not one of his disciples, are you?" He denied it, saying, "I am not." It's a story that has been repeated many times over the years, and it's one that the New York Times revisits today in a piece titled, "The Hidden History of Jesus' Death." In the piece, the author recounts the story of how a servant girl saw Jesus and said, "This fellow is one of them." He denied it again, with an oath: "I don't know the man!" When the servant girl saw him.

The son of God's answer: "Again Peter denied it."
– The rooster crowed, and then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: "Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed, and at that moment a rooster began to crow." That's how it went down, according to the New York Times, which recounts the story of Jesus' encounter with a rooster in Galilee. The rooster was about 100 yards away, and when Peter approached, the rooster suddenly appeared and began to crow. "Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: 'Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed, and at that moment a rooster began to crow,'" the Times quotes the story.

"He broke down and wept. The Lord looked straight at Peter."
– It's the story of a group of men who heard a voice tell them, "If you are the Christ, tell us." The elders of the people said, "tell us." Jesus answered, "If I tell you, you will not believe me, and if I asked you, you would not answer. But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God." They all asked, "Are you then the Son of God?" He replied, "You are right in saying I am." Then they said, "Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from his own lips." Jesus said to them, "We have heard it from his own lips."
– The story of how Jesus' disciples used blood money to buy a potter's field is a fascinating one, and it's a story that's been told before—but it's getting new attention thanks to the book of Acts. The account of Judas Isidore's suicide is told in the Gospel of John, and the account of how Jesus' disciples used blood money to buy the field is recounted in the New Testament as the "Field of Blood."

"I have sinned," he said, "for I have.
– The story of how Jesus was executed has a lot in common with the modern version of the Bible, but it's a little different this time around. In the Gospel of Matthew, the Jews led Jesus to the palace of the Roman governor, where he was accused of being a traitor to the nation and sentenced to death. The Jews refused to execute him because they didn't want to unclean up the palace for Passover, so he was taken to Pilate, where he was charged with crimes. "If he were not a criminal," the Jews said, "we would not have handed him over to you." Pilate asked, "What charges are you bringing against this man?" The Jews replied, "If he were not a criminal,.

"Yes, it is as you say." When the chief priests and elders accused him of wrongdoing, he said nothing. Then Pilate asked him, "Don't you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?" He said nothing, then replied, "Yes, it is as you say." When the chief priests and elders accused him of wrongdoing.
– The story of how Jesus came to be known as the Son of God is a tale of triumph and tragedy, but it's also a tale of triumph and tragedy—and that's what's happening right now, according to the New York Times. In the Gospel of John, Jesus is said to have been taken from Galilee to Jerusalem, where he was under the jurisdiction of Herod, the king of Judea. When he arrived in Jerusalem, Herod sent him to Pilate, who was also in Jerusalem at the time. When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased, because for a long time he had been wanting to see him. From what he had heard about him, Herod hoped to see him perform some miracle. He p.

– The story of how Jesus was released from prison—and the story of how he is commemorated on the first night of Passover—is getting a lot of attention this week, thanks in part to a New York Times Magazine piece by Maureen Dowd. In it, Dowd recounts the story of Pilate, who was asked by the crowd at the time, "Which one do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?" The crowd had chosen Barabbas, and Pilate knew it was out of envy that they had given Jesus to them. "But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to release 'the king of the.
– The story of Jesus' crucifixion is a grim one, but it's one that's been told before. In the Gospel of John, the crowd gathered around Jesus as he was about to be put to death, and the governor asked, "Which of the two do you want me to release to you?" The crowd answered, "Barabbas." The crowd's answer: "Barabbas," referring to the son of David who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder. When the governor refused to release Barabbas, the crowd shouted, "Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!" (Barabbas had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city, and for murder.
– The story of how Jesus was crucified continues to resonate today, in part because of the Roman Catholic Church's opposition to the idea. Here's a look at some of the key quotes, courtesy of the Los Angeles Times: The crowd: "What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called Christ?" Pilate asked. They all answered, "Crucify him!" "Why? What crime has he committed?" Pilate asked them. "Crucify him!" They shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!" Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate appealed to them again. But they kept shouting, "Crucify him!" For the third time he spoke to them: "Why? What crime has this man.
– The story of Jesus' death and resurrection is well-known, but the account of his beating and flogging is a little less well-known. That's thanks in part to the fact that it's written in the Book of Isaiah, which the New York Times points out is "by far the most widely read account of the death and resurrection of a human being." But it's not just the account of the beating that's widely read—it's the account of the soldiers who led him into the palace after he'd been taken there by the governor's soldiers, who then mocked him and spit on him. The soldiers then called out to him, "Hail, king of the Jews!" and.
– The story of Jesus' crucifixion is one of the most well-known in Christian history, and it's about to get even more well-known. The AP has a look at the account in the Gospel of Matthew, which begins: "Here is your king. Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!Shall I crucify your king?" shouted the Jews. "We have no king but Caesar," replied the chief priests. The Jews kept shouting, "If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar." When the Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat at a place known as the.
– Remember the story of Jesus Christ washing the hands of those accused of plotting to kill him? Well, it turns out he was actually washing his own hands, too, according to a new book. In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus is said to have washed the hands of those accused of plotting to kill him before he was put to death, reports the Telegraph. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility!" All the people answered, "Let his blood be on us and on our children!" The book's author, however, says that's not true—and that's probably why the crowd reacted the way they did.
– In the Gospel of John, Jesus is said to have been taken to the well of the well of David, where he was given a drink of wine and told, "This is my brother, you who are in my name." He was then taken to the well of David, where he was again given a drink and told, "This is my brother, you who are in my name." He was then taken to the well of David, where he was again given a drink and told, "This is my brother, you who are in my name."

– It's a story that's been told before, but it's getting new attention thanks to a New York Times Magazine cover story that's making headlines. The cover story, which first appeared in the Times Magazine's September issue, tells the story of Jesus Christ as a young man. It's based on the Gospel of John, which recounts the story of a group of soldiers who mocked him and made fun of him, then led him away to crucify him. The soldiers then took charge of Jesus, who was carrying his own cross, and led him to what's called the "skull" (in Aramaic, it's called Golgotha) where he was crucified. The.
– The story of how Jesus carried the cross—and how it was made for a man who didn't carry it—is a fascinating one, and it's one that's been told before. The New York Times revisits it in its latest Bible study, and it's not hard to figure out why: The disciples were going out to eat when they met a man from Cyrene named Simon, and as they were going out he was forced to carry the cross. As they led him away, they seized Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus. The story continues: "As they were going out, they met.
– It's a story that's been told before, but it's getting new attention thanks to a New York Times op-ed by an ex-journalist, and it's a story that's getting a lot of attention because of it. It's from the book of Hosea, and it tells the story of a group of young Jewish women who'd been told by their parents that Jesus was coming to them, and that if they didn't weep for him, he'd soon come to them in a coffin. The women didn't weep for him, but they did cry for him, and the story recounts how the disciples followed him, including the women who'd cried for him.
– When it comes to the Catholic Church, the "here" and "now" are conflated, and the "what" part is getting lost in all the confusion. The New York Times takes a look at the "what" part, and finds that the church's official line is that "the Holy Father is the head of the church." But the Times also notes that the Vatican has been trying to distance itself from the "what" part, and that the church's official line is that the pope is the head of the church. (The Vatican's official line is that the pope is the head of the church.) The Times also digs into the history of the church's relationship with the pope, and.

It's time for us to come together as one. It's time to come together as a family. It's time to come together as one under the leadership of the president of the United States." Romney, speaking at a joint press conference with Obama at the White House, said Romney and Obama have a lot in common. "We.
– When Jesus was put to death on the cross, the soldiers who watched over him took his clothes and divided them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. "Let's not tear it," they said to one another. "Let's decide by lot who will get it." The soldiers then cast lots to see who would get the remaining shares, the Daily Mail reports.

– "What I have written, I have written." That's how Pontius Pilate, the Pilate who oversaw the execution of Jesus, responded when Jews protested that he should not write "The King of the Jews" on the cross. "Do not write 'The King of the Jews,' but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews," the chief priests of the Jews said. Pilate replied, "What I have written, I have written." The Jews continued to protest, "Do not write 'The King of the Jews,' but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews." Pilate's response: "What I have written, I have written." The New York Times has the full text of the.

– The story of Jesus Christ's death and resurrection is a well-known one, but it's been a little under-reported—until now. In the Gospel of John, Jesus is said to have been resurrected from the dead on the third day after his crucifixion. The New York Times has a nice explainer of the story, but it doesn't get into much detail. Here's a sample of what the Times has to say: The story: It's said that after his death on the cross, Jesus was resurrected on the third day after his crucifixion. He was taken from the cross to the grave, where he was buried. He was then taken again to the tomb, where he was again crucified.

– It's a tale of thirsty Jesus, retold in the Gospel of John, and it involves a jar of wine vinegar. When Jesus was about to drink from it, one of the men in the crowd offered him a sponge filled with wine vinegar, and Jesus said, "I am thirsty." The men soaked the sponge in the vinegar, put it on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus' lips.
– "Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down." That was one of the lines from the Bible's King David to Solomon in the Gospel of Solomon, according to the New York Daily News. It's a line that Solomon repeated several times in the Gospel of Solomon as the king tried to protect his people from the coming of the coming of the Messiah. The king's message was that the coming of the Messiah would be a good thing, and that the coming of the Messiah would be a good thing for the people. Solomon's words were intended to protect the people from the coming of the Messiah, not the coming of the Messiah himself. The New York Times reports that Solomon'
– It's the story of a washed-up Jesus: He was on a boat in the Dead Sea when a crew member tossed a drink into the sea. The crew member was Jesus, who was on the boat with his wife, Mary, and two young children. As the water turned dark, the crew member yelled, "It's finished!"

Wuerl tells the AP that he doesn't think there's much that can be done about climate change, but that the UN needs to do more to help developing countries get on board.

But when they heard that he had been alive and that she had seen him, they did not believe it. When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others.
