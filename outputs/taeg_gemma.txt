[Event 1] Six days before the Passover, Jesus arrived at Bethany, where Lazarus, whom Jesus had raised from the dead, also resided. A dinner was given in Jesus’ honor, with Martha serving and Lazarus reclining at the table. While at the home of a man known as Simon the Leper, Jesus was reclining at a table when a woman approached. She carried an alabaster jar containing a pint of pure nard, an extremely expensive perfume.  As Jesus reclined, the woman broke the jar and poured the perfume on his feet, simultaneously wiping them with her hair. The house was immediately filled with a powerful fragrance.

Some of Jesus’ disciples, including Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, reacted with indignation. Judas, as keeper of the money bag, questioned the extravagance, stating, “Why wasn’t this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year’s wages.” Judas’s motivation stemmed from his own theft from the money bag.

Others, including some of the unnamed disciples, voiced similar concerns, arguing, “Why this waste of perfume? It could have been sold for more than a year’s wages and the money given to the poor.” Jesus rebuked them, saying, “Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to me. The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have me. When she poured this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.” He affirmed that wherever the gospel was preached throughout the world, what she had done would be told in memory of her.
[Event 2] Meanwhile, a large crowd of Jews discovered Jesus was present and came, not only to him but also to see Lazarus, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. The chief priests, recognizing the growing influence of Lazarus, made plans to kill him as well, because many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and putting their faith in him.
[Event 3] The next day, the great crowd that had come for the Feast heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the King of Israel!”.
[Event 4] As Jesus approached Bethphage and Bethany at the hill called the Mount of Olives, he instructed two of his disciples to proceed to the village ahead. They were to find a young donkey tied at a doorway, which no one had ever ridden. Specifically, they were to untie it and bring it directly to him.  If anyone questioned their actions, they were to respond, “The Lord needs it, and will send it back here shortly.” 

The disciples followed Jesus’s instructions precisely. Upon arriving, they located the donkey tied outside, and as they untied it, some people standing nearby inquired, “Why are you untying that colt?” The disciples responded with the phrase Jesus had instructed them to use: “The Lord needs it.” They then brought the donkey to Jesus, and they threw their cloaks over it, placing Jesus upon the animal. 

At first, his disciples did not fully understand the significance of this event. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these actions were foretold in scripture, mirroring the prophecy: “Do not be afraid, O Daughter of Zion; see, your king is coming, seated on a donkey’s colt.”.
[Event 5] As Jesus went along, a very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and fields, spreading them as a pathway. Those who went ahead of him and those who followed shouted, “Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!” As he approached the place where the road descends the Mount of Olives, the entire crowd of disciples began to praise God in loud voices, rejoicing in the miracles they had witnessed. “Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!” Some Pharisees within the crowd observed Jesus and demanded that he rebuke his disciples. In response, Jesus stated, “I tell you, if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out.”.
[Event 6] As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it and said, “If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace—but now it is hidden from your eyes. The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side. They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of God’s coming to you.”.
[Event 7] When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, “Who is this?” The crowds answered, “This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.” The crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word of his miracles. Many people, having heard of this miraculous sign, went out to meet him. The Pharisees, observing the growing number of followers, said to one another, “See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!”.
[Event 8] Jesus entered Jerusalem and went to the temple. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve. And he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where he spent the night.
[Event 9] Early in the morning, as he was on his way back to the city, he was hungry. Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. The next day, as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry. Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs. Then he said to the tree, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” And his disciples heard him say it.
[Event 10] Jesus entered the temple area and began driving out those who were buying and selling. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves. “It is written,” he said to them, “‘My house will be a house of prayer,’” but they had made it “a den of robbers.”.
[Event 11] The chief priests and teachers of the law heard Jesus’s words and began looking for a way to kill him. They feared him, as the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching. Every day he was teaching at the temple, and the chief priests, along with the teachers of the law and the leaders among the people, were actively trying to find a means to eliminate him. Despite their efforts, they could not discover a way to carry out their intent, because all the people hung on his words.
[Event 12] Jesus was approached at the temple by the blind and the lame, whom he healed. The scene was further animated by children in the temple area shouting, “Hosanna to the Son of David.” The chief priests and teachers of the law observed these events and questioned Jesus, inquiring, “Do you hear what these children are saying?” Jesus responded, “Yes,” and cited scripture: “‘From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise.’”.
[Event 13] When evening came, they went out of the city.
[Event 14] Each day, Jesus was teaching at the temple, and each evening he would go out to spend the night on the hill called the Mount of Olives. All the people came early in the morning to hear him at the temple.
[Event 15] In the morning, as they went along, the disciples observed the fig tree withered from its roots. Peter remembered Jesus’s earlier words and exclaimed, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered!” Jesus responded, “Have faith in God.” He then explained, “I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and it will be done. If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.”  He emphasized the importance of unwavering belief, stating, “Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.”  Furthermore, Jesus added, “And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins.”.
[Event 16] One day as he was teaching the people in the temple courts and preaching the gospel, the chief priests, the teachers of the law, together with the elders, came up to Jesus. “Tell us by what authority you are doing these things,” they demanded. “Who gave you this authority?” Jesus replied, “I will also ask you a question. Tell me, John’s baptism—was it from heaven, or from men?” They immediately began to discuss it amongst themselves, and stated, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’ But if we say, ‘From men’—all the people will stone us, because they are persuaded that John was a prophet.”  They answered Jesus, “We don’t know.” Jesus said, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”.
[Event 17] “What do you think?” Jesus began, addressing a group. “There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work today in the vineyard.’ ‘I will not,’ he answered. Later, he changed his mind and went. Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing. He answered, ‘I will, sir,’ but he did not go. ‘Which of the two did what his father wanted?’ they asked. ‘The first,’ they answered. Jesus then said to them, ‘I tell you the truth, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you. John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him.’”.
[Event 18] The landowner began to teach a lesson through a parable. He planted a vineyard and, after constructing a wall around it, a winepress, and a watchtower, he rented it to some farmers and departed on a long journey. At harvest time, he dispatched a servant to the tenants to collect a portion of the vineyard’s fruit. However, the tenants seized the servant, beat him severely, and then sent him away empty-handed.  Frustrated, they then sent a second servant, and this one was struck on the head and treated with extreme shame before also being dismissed without payment.  He was followed by a third servant, who suffered wounds and was expelled from the vineyard. 

Determined to find someone who would respect him, the landowner then sent his son, whom he deeply loved.  But upon seeing the son, the tenants immediately plotted against him. They said to one another, “This is the heir. Let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.”  Acting on this murderous intent, they seized the son and threw him out of the vineyard, ultimately killing him. 

When asked what the landowner would do in response, the listeners replied, “He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.”  A sense of dread filled the air as they uttered this final, ominous judgment.
[Event 19] Jesus looked directly at them and said, “Haven’t you read this scripture: “‘The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?” He then explained, “Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit. Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed.”.
[Event 20] When the chief priests and Pharisees heard Jesus’ parables, they knew he was speaking about them. The teachers of the law, along with the chief priests, looked for a way to arrest him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. They were afraid of the crowd, who held that he was a prophet, and so they left him and went away.
[Event 21] Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son. He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come. ” Then he sent some more servants and said, ‘Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.’ But they paid no attention and went off—one to his field, another to his business. The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them. The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. “For many are invited, but few are chosen.”

Then he said to his servants, “The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come. Go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.” So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.

When the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes. ‘Friend,’ he asked, ‘how did you get in here without wedding clothes?’ The man was speechless. Then the king told the attendants, “Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”.
[Event 22] Keeping a close watch on Jesus, the Pharisees, along with spies posing as honest individuals, attempted to trap him in his words and hand him over to the power and authority of the governor. They approached Jesus, claiming to recognize his integrity and his adherence to the way of God in accordance with truth. They questioned him, stating, “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach what is right, and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with truth. Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?” Jesus, perceiving their duplicity and evil intent, immediately challenged their tactic. He asked them to “Show me a denarius.” They presented the coin to him, and he inquired, “Whose portrait is this? And whose inscription?” They replied, “Caesar’s.” Then Jesus stated, “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”  Upon hearing this, the Pharisees and spies were astonished by his answer and, unable to trap him in his words publicly, they fell silent and departed.
[Event 23] That same day, some of the Sadducees, who maintained that there was no resurrection, approached Jesus with a question. “Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother. Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died childless. The second and then the third married her, and in the same way the seven died, leaving no children. Finally, the woman died too. Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?”

Jesus replied, pointing out their error. “You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God. When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven. Now about the dead rising--have you not read what God said to you, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.”

Jesus continued, emphasizing that the people of this age marry and are given in marriage, but those considered worthy of participating in the coming age and the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage, and they can no longer die; for they are God’s children, since they are children of the resurrection. He referenced the account of the bush, drawing upon Moses’ words: “‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’ He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive.” The crowds were astonished at his teaching.
[Event 24] Some of the teachers of the law, having heard Jesus silence the Sadducees, gathered to question him. One of them, an expert in the law, approached Jesus and, noticing the insightful answer he had given, posed a direct inquiry: “Of all the commandments, which is the most important?” Jesus responded, “‘Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’ This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”  Upon hearing this, the teachers of the law responded with agreement, stating, “Well said, teacher!”  And no one dared to ask him any more questions.  Jesus, perceiving their understanding, affirmed, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.”.
[Event 25] While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he posed a direct question to the Pharisees: “How is it that they say the Christ is the Son of David? David himself declares in the Book of Psalms: “‘The Lord said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.’” David calls him ‘Lord.’ How then can he be his son?” Jesus specifically referenced the passage from the Psalms to emphasize the contradiction. The large crowd listened to him with delight.  He continued, asking the Pharisees, “How is it that they say the Christ is the Son of David?”  No one could reply, and from that day on, no one dared to ask him any more questions.
[Event 26] While all the people were listening, Jesus addressed his disciples and the crowds, speaking about the teachers of the law and the Pharisees. He instructed them to obey the teachings of these men, but emphatically warned against imitating their actions. Jesus observed that they “like to walk around in flowing robes and love to be greeted in the marketplaces and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.” He criticized their behavior, noting that they “devour widows’ houses and for a show make lengthy prayers.”  He specifically forbade them from calling anyone on earth “father,” stating that they had “one Father, and he is in heaven,” and similarly cautioned against being called “teacher,” asserting that “you have one Teacher, the Christ.”  Jesus concluded by stating that “the greatest among you will be your servant. For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.”.
[Event 27] “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites!” The words resonated with profound condemnation. You shut the kingdom of heaven in men’s faces, refusing to let those striving to enter. You traveled across land and sea, seeking only a single convert, yet when they became followers, you made them twice as much children of hell as yourselves. You called yourselves blind guides, stating, “If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.” You declared yourselves blind, questioning which was greater: the gold or the temple that made the gold sacred. Similarly, you insisted that “If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift on it, he is bound by his oath.” You were blind men, questioning which was greater: the gift or the altar that made the gift sacred.  You recognized that he who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it. Likewise, he who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it. And he who swears by heaven swears by God’s throne and by the one who sits on it.

You were described as “snakes! You brood of vipers!” and the condemnation continued: “How will you escape being condemned to hell?”  You were accused of prioritizing superficial rituals, giving a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cummin—while neglecting the more important matters of the law: justice, mercy and faithfulness. You strained out a gnat but swallowed a camel. You cleaned the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you were full of greed and self-indulgence. You appeared righteous to others, but on the inside you were full of hypocrisy and wickedness. You built tombs for the prophets and decorated the graves of the righteous, claiming that if they had lived in the days of their forefathers, they wouldn’t have taken part in shedding the blood of the prophets.  Yet, your actions testified against yourselves, revealing yourselves as the descendants of those who murdered the prophets. 

The weight of this accumulated sin, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar, would fall upon this generation.  You were portrayed as “whitewashed tombs,” appearing beautiful on the outside but harboring “dead men’s bones and everything unclean.”  Therefore, you were warned that all this would come upon this generation.
[Event 28] “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing. For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.’”.
[Event 29] As Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put, he observed the crowd diligently placing their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts, while a poor widow approached and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a fraction of a penny. Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, “I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. They all gave their gifts out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in all she had to live on.”.
[Event 30] As Jesus was leaving the temple, some of his disciples remarked on the beautiful stones and the gifts dedicated to God, observing the impressive buildings. One disciple exclaimed, “Look, Teacher! What massive stones! What magnificent buildings!” Jesus responded, “Do you see all these great buildings?” He then stated, “I tell you the truth, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.”.
[Event 31] As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples—Peter, James, John, and Andrew—came to him privately. “Teacher,” they asked, “when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are all about to take place?”.
[Event 32] Jesus warned them to watch out that no one would deceive them. He stated that many would come in his name, claiming, “I am the Christ,” and “I am he,” and “The time is near.” He cautioned them not to follow these individuals.
[Event 33] When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed; such events must happen, but the end is still to come. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places, and fearful events and great signs from heaven. These occurrences represent the beginning of birth pains. You must be on your guard, as you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. 

During this time, you will be delivered to the local councils and flogged in the synagogues. On account of me, you will stand before governors and kings as witnesses.  It is crucial that you make up your mind not to worry beforehand about how you will defend yourselves; rather, simply say whatever is given you at the time, for it is not you speaking, but the Holy Spirit. Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death. All men will hate you because of me. 

Furthermore, you will be betrayed even by parents, brothers, relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death.  Despite this, not a hair of your head will perish; by standing firm to the end, you will gain life. The gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.
[Event 34] When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you will know that its desolation is near. Then, those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains, and those in the city must get out, while those in the country should not enter the city. This is the time of punishment, a fulfillment of all that has been written.  Let no one on the roof of his house go down or enter the house to take anything out. Let no one in the field go back to get his cloak. How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! There will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people. They will fall by the sword and will be taken as prisoners to all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled. 

Let no one on the roof of his house go down or enter the house to take anything out. Let no one in the field go back to get his cloak.  When you see ‘the abomination that causes desolation’ standing where it does not belong – let the reader understand – then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.  If those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect, whom he has chosen, those days will be shortened. There will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people. How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! This distress will be unequaled from the beginning, when God created the world, until now – and never to be equaled again. Pray that this will not take place in winter, because those will be days of distress unequaled from the beginning, when God created the world, until now – and never to be equaled again.
[Event 35] At that time, if anyone says to you, “Look, here is the Christ!” or “Look, there he is!” do not believe it. False Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the elect—if that were possible. I have told you ahead of time to be on your guard. Specifically, if anyone tells you, “Look, here is the Christ!” or “Look, there he is!”, do not go out to meet them, nor believe them, as I have warned you.
[Event 36] Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather.
[Event 37] “Immediately after a time of distress, the prophecies foretold a dramatic upheaval: ‘the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.’ This period of anguish was marked by signs in the sun, moon, and stars. On the earth, nations would experience anguish and perplexity, witnessing the roaring and tossing of the sea. Men would faint from terror, apprehensive of what was coming on the world, due to the shaking of the heavenly bodies. 

At that time, they would see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with great power and glory. He would send his angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens.  It was a time to ‘stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.’”.
[Event 38] “Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near. Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that the kingdom of God is near. I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.”.
[Event 39] No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
[Event 40] That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. Just as it was in the days of Noah, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away.
[Event 41] Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left. The narrative emphasizes the importance of vigilance, stating, “Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come.” It draws a parallel to a homeowner who, had he known the time of a thief’s arrival, would have maintained watch and prevented the house from being broken into.
[Event 42] “Be careful, or your hearts will be weighed down with dissipation, drunkenness, and the anxieties of life; that day will close on you unexpectedly like a trap. It will come upon all those who live on the face of the whole earth. You do not know when that time will come, and you must be ready. The Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him. 

Like a man going away, one leaves his house and puts his servants in charge, each with his assigned task, and tells the one at the door to keep watch.  The servant’s master will find him doing his work, and he will be put in charge of all his possessions. However, if the servant is wicked and says to himself, ‘My master is staying away a long time,’ and he then begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards, the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  You must be alert and ready, for the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.”.
[Event 43] At that time, the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them, while the wise took oil in jars along with their lamps. The bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep. At midnight, the cry rang out: ‘Here’s the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!’ Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps. The foolish ones said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.’ The wise replied, ‘No, there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.’ But while they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. The door was shut, and the others, ‘Sir! Sir!’ they said, ‘Open the door for us!’ But he replied, ‘I tell you the truth, I don’t know you.’ Therefore, keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour.
[Event 44] The master embarked on a journey, entrusting his possessions to three servants, distributing five, two, and one talents of money according to their individual abilities. The servant who received five talents immediately set to work, gaining five more, totaling ten. Similarly, the servant with two talents increased his holdings to twelve. However, the servant who received only one talent acted with fear and deceit. He did not invest the money or utilize it productively; instead, he dug a hole in the ground and concealed his master’s money. 

Upon the master’s return, the servant with five talents presented ten talents, declaring, “Master, you entrusted me with five talents. See, I have gained five more.” The master praised him, stating, “Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!” The servant with two talents also arrived and reported having gained twelve talents, receiving similar commendation and a promise of increased responsibility. 

Finally, the servant who had received the single talent appeared, explaining his actions: “Master, you know that I am a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. So I was afraid and went out and hid your talent in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.” The master rebuked him severely, stating, “You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where you have not scattered seed? Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest.” The master then took the talent from this servant and gave it to the servant with ten talents, emphasizing that everyone who has will be given more, and whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him. He banished the worthless servant “outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”.
[Event 45] When the Son of Man comes in his glory, accompanied by all the angels, he will take his throne in heavenly glory and gather all the nations before him. He will then separate the people, as a shepherd separates sheep from goats. He will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left. 

To those on his right, he will proclaim, “Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.” The righteous will respond, “Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?”

He will reply, “I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.” 

To those on his left, he will say, “Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.” They will also respond, “Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?”

He will reply, “I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.” 

Those judged unworthy will be condemned to eternal punishment, while the righteous will inherit eternal life.
[Event 46] Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the Feast, and they came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. “Sir,” they said, “we would like to see Jesus.” Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus. Jesus replied, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. The man who loves his life will lose it, while the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me.”

As Jesus spoke, his heart was troubled, and he said, “Father, save me from this hour?” But he immediately corrected himself, stating, “No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour. Father, glorify your name!” 

A voice came from heaven, declaring, “I have glorified it, and will glorify it again.” The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him. Jesus then explained, “This voice was for your benefit, not mine. Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out. But I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.” He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die.

The crowd spoke up, “We have heard from the Law that the Christ will remain forever, so how can you say, ‘The Son of Man must be lifted up’?” They questioned, “Who is this ‘Son of Man’?”

Jesus responded, “You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. The man who walks in the dark does not know where he is going. Put your trust in the light while you have it, so that you may become sons of light.”.
[Event 47] When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them.
[Event 48] As Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples, “As you know, the Passover is two days away—and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.”.
[Event 49] Now, as the Feast of Unleavened Bread, known as the Passover, approached, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, whose name was Caiaphas, assembled in the palace of the high priest. They were looking for some sly way to arrest Jesus and kill him, driven by fear of the people. “But not during the Feast,” they said, “or the people may riot.”.
[Event 50] Then Satan entered Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve. Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus. The chief priests were delighted to hear this proposal and promised Judas thirty silver coins if he would hand Jesus over to them. From then on, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no crowd was present.
[Event 51] Even after Jesus had performed numerous miraculous signs before them, the crowds remained unwilling to believe in him. This situation was directly linked to the prophecy of Isaiah the prophet, specifically the verse: “Lord, who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?” Isaiah’s words seemed to indicate a deliberate obstruction of faith. He stated, “He has blinded their eyes and deadened their hearts, so they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn—and I would heal them.” Isaiah’s observation stemmed from witnessing Jesus’ glory. Despite this, many leaders, including some among them, did believe in Jesus. However, the Pharisees actively prevented others from confessing their faith, driven by a desire for human praise rather than reverence for God, fearing excommunication from the synagogue.
[Event 52] Then Jesus cried out, “When a man believes in me, he does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me. When he looks at me, he sees the one who sent me.” He stated that he had come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in him should stay in darkness. Jesus clarified that he did not come to judge the world, but to save it, and that a person who hears his words but does not keep them would not be judged. He explained that his words were guided by the Father, who commanded him what to say and how to say it, and that this command leads to eternal life.  Furthermore, he asserted that the word he spoke would condemn the one who rejects him at the last day.
[Event 53] (Jesus rests?).
[Event 54] On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus instructed Peter and John to make preparations for the Passover meal. He directed them to go into the city and to follow a man carrying a jar of water. When they encountered this man, they were to say to the owner of the house, “The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?” The owner would then lead them to a large upper room, already furnished and ready. The disciples followed these instructions, finding the room exactly as Jesus had described it, and they proceeded to prepare the Passover meal.
[Event 55] When the hour came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve.
[Event 56] And he said to them, “I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God.”.
[Event 57] It was just before the Passover Feast, and Jesus knew the time had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he now showed them the full extent of his love. At the evening meal, the devil had already prompted Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, to betray Jesus. Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God. Rising from the meal, Jesus took off his outer clothing and wrapped a towel around his waist. He then poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples’ feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him. He approached Simon Peter, who asked, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?” Jesus replied, “You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.” Peter responded, “No, you shall never wash my feet.” Jesus answered, “Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.” Simon Peter then said, “Then, Lord, not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!” Jesus responded, “A person who has had a bath needs only to wash his feet; his whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you.” He knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not every one was clean. After he had finished washing their feet, Jesus put on his clothes and returned to his place. He then asked them, “Do you understand what I have done for you?” They called him ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and rightly so, for that is what he was. Jesus then stated, “Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another’s feet. I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you. I tell you the truth, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.”.
[Event 58] “I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me,” Jesus stated, his words hanging in the air as they were reclining at the table eating. He emphasized that this was not a statement directed at all of them, but rather a specific warning about one among those present. He referenced a scripture – “He who shares my bread has lifted up his heel against me” – explaining that this betrayal was predetermined and intended to fulfill prophecy. Jesus then, troubled in spirit, repeated his warning, stating, “I tell you the truth, one of you is going to betray me.” He clarified that this action was part of a larger, divinely ordained plan, and that accepting anyone he sent would be accepting him, and consequently, the one who sent him.
[Event 59] As a growing sense of sadness washed over them, the disciples began to question among themselves, seeking to determine which of them would betray Jesus. One by one, they voiced their disbelief, saying, “Surely not I, Lord?” Jesus responded, “The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me. The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.” 

Amidst this confusion, one of his disciples, the one whom Jesus loved, was reclining next to him. Simon Peter, observing the scene, motioned to this disciple and said, “Ask him which one he means.” Leaning back against Jesus, Simon Peter asked, “Lord, who is it?” The disciples continued to express their dismay, repeating the question, “Surely not I, Lord?” Jesus firmly replied, “Yes, it is you.”.
[Event 60] Jesus answered, “It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.” Then, dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, son of Simon. As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him.
[Event 61] “What you are about to do, do quickly,” Jesus told him, but no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him. Since Judas had charge of the money, some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the Feast, or to give something to the poor. As soon as Judas had taken the bread, he went out, and it was night.
[Event 62] When he was gone, Jesus spoke, “Now is the Son of Man glorified and God is glorified in him. If God is glorified in him, God will glorify the Son in himself, and will glorify him at once.” He continued, “My children, I will be with you only a little longer. You will look for me, and just as I told the Jews, so I tell you now: Where I am going, you cannot come.” Then, Jesus gave a new command: “I give you a new command: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this all men will know that you are my disciples.”.
[Event 63] While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, “Take and eat; this is my body.” He added, “This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.”.
[Event 64] Then, after the supper, he took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them. “This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins,” he said to them, and they all drank from it. This cup represents the new covenant in his blood.
[Event 65] After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, “Take this and divide it among you. For I tell you I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in my Father’s kingdom.”.
[Event 66] Jesus said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors. But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves. For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? But I am among you as one who serves. You are those who have stood by me in my trials, and I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me, so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”.
[Event 67] Simon Peter asked Jesus, “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus replied, “Where I am going, you cannot follow now, but you will follow later.” Peter responded, “Lord, why can’t I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.” Jesus then said to him, “Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift you as wheat. But I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.” Jesus answered, “I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.”.
[Event 68] “Do not let your hearts be troubled,” Jesus said, “Trust in God; trust also in me. In my Father’s house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am. You know the way to the place where I am going.”

Thomas asked, “Lord, we don’t know where you are going, so how can we know the way?” Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you really knew me, you would know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.”

Philip then said, “Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us.” Jesus responded, “Don’t you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’? Don’t you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you are not just my own. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work. Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the miracles themselves. I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father.”.
[Event 69] “If you love me,” Jesus began, “you will obey what I command. I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever—the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him; but you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you. I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you. Whoever has my commands and obeys them, he is the one who loves me. He who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love him and show myself to him.”

Jesus continued, clarifying that the words he spoke were not his own, but belonged to the Father who sent him. He emphasized that he was going away and returning, and that this departure was meant to foster belief. “I have told you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe.”

Then, a man identified only as “Judas” (not Judas Iscariot) asked, “But, Lord, why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?” Jesus responded, “If anyone loves me, he will obey my teaching. My Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him. He who does not love me will not obey my teaching.”

Jesus then offered his peace to his disciples, stating, “Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.” He explained that he was preparing them for the arrival of the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, who would be sent in his name to teach them all things and remind them of everything he had said. 

Jesus stated that the “prince of this world” was coming, and that while he had no hold on him, the world needed to understand that he loved the Father and that he was faithfully executing his Father’s commands.
[Event 70] When Jesus asked them, “When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?” they answered, “Nothing.” Jesus then said, “But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don’t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.” He cited scripture, stating, “And he was numbered with the transgressors’; and he declared that this must be fulfilled in him. The disciples observed that they possessed two swords, and Jesus replied, “See, Lord, here are two swords. That is enough,” indicating their understanding of the need for preparedness.
[Event 71] When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him. “Come now; let us leave.”.
[Event 72] Then Jesus told them, “This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written: “‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’ But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.” Peter replied, “Even if all fall away, I will not.” “I tell you the truth,” Jesus answered, “today—yes, tonight—before the rooster crows twice you yourself will disown me three times.” But Peter insisted emphatically, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.” And all the others said the same.
[Event 73] “I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener,” I said, “He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful. You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you. Remain in me, and I will remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me.” 

I continued, “I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you. You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit—fruit that will last.  If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be given you. This is to my Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples. As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. You are my friends if you do what I command. I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you. If anyone does not remain in me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned. I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete. My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.”.
[Event 74] “If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own, but as it is, you do not belong to the world, and I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you. Remember the words I spoke to you: ‘No servant is greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also; if they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also. They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know the One who sent me. If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin. Now, however, they have no excuse for their sin. He who hates me hates my Father as well. If I had not done among them what no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. They hated me without reason. Furthermore, when the Counselor comes—whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father—he will testify about me, and you also must testify, for you have been with me from the beginning.”.
[Event 75] “Now I am going to him who sent me, yet none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’ Because I have said these things, you are filled with grief. I tell you the truth: It is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. When he, the Counselor, comes, he will convict the world of guilt in regard to sin and righteousness and judgment: in regard to sin, because men do not believe in me; in regard to righteousness, because I am going to the Father, where you can see me no longer; and in regard to judgment, because the prince of this world now stands condemned. I have much more to say to you, more than you can now bear. When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come. He will bring glory to me by taking from what is mine and making it known to you. All that belongs to the Father is mine.”.
[Event 76] Jesus was speaking to his disciples when they began to question his words, specifically, “In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me,” and “Because I am going to the Father?” They kept asking, “What does he mean by ‘a little while’? We don’t understand what he is saying.” Jesus perceived their confusion and their desire to understand the deeper meaning of his statements. He responded, “Are you asking one another what I meant when I said, ‘In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me’?” He then explained, “I tell you the truth, you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices. You will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy. A woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come; but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world. So with you: Now is your time of grief, but I will see you again and you will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy. In that day you will no longer ask me anything. I tell you the truth, my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name. Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete.”.
[Event 77] “Though I have been speaking figuratively, a time is coming when I will no longer use this kind of language but will tell you plainly about my Father. In that day you will ask in my name. I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf. No, the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God. I came from the Father and entered the world; now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father.”

Then Jesus’ disciples said, “Now you are speaking clearly and without figures of speech. Now we can see that you know all things and that you do not even need to have anyone ask you questions. This makes us believe that you came from God.” Jesus answered, “You believe at last!” 

“But a time is coming, and has come, when you will be scattered, each to his own home. You will leave me all alone. Yet I am not alone, for my Father is with me. I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.”.
[Event 78] After Jesus spoke these words, he looked toward heaven and began to pray, “Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you. You granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him. This eternal life is knowing you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you sent. I have brought you glory on earth by completing the work you gave me to do. Now, Father, glorify me in your presence, with the glory I had with you before the world began. I have revealed you to those whom you gave me out of the world; they were yours, you gave them to me, and they have obeyed your word. They now know that everything you have given me comes from you. I gave them the words you gave me, and they accepted them, knowing with certainty that I came from you and believed that you sent me. 

I pray for those you have given me, not for the world, but for them, for they are yours, and all I have is yours, and all you have is mine. Glory has come to me through them. I will remain in the world no longer, but they are still in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name—the name you gave me—so that they may be one as we are one. While I was with them, I protected them and kept them safe by that name you gave me. None has been lost except the one doomed to destruction, so that Scripture would be fulfilled. 

I am coming to you now, but I say these things while I am still in the world, so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them. I have given them your word, and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of it. My prayer is not that you take them out of the world, but that you protect them from the evil one. They are not of the world, even as I am not of it. Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth. As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world. For them, I sanctify myself, that they too may be truly sanctified. 

My prayer is not solely for them; I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me. I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one: I in them and you in me. May they be brought to complete unity to let the world know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me. 

Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, and to see my glory, the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world. Righteous Father, though the world does not know you, I know you, and they know that you have sent me. I have made you known to them, and will continue to make you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them.”.
[Event 79] Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.” He took Peter, James, and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled. “My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death,” he said to them. Before he began to pray, he instructed them, “Pray that you will not fall into temptation.” As he began to pray, he and his disciples entered an olive grove, which was located on the other side of the Kidron Valley. When he had finished praying, Jesus left with his disciples and crossed the Kidron Valley into the olive grove.
[Event 80] Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, “My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.” He withdrew about a stone’s throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed, “Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.” He was in anguish, praying more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground. An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him. Returning to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow.
[Event 81] Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. Addressing Peter, he asked, “Simon, are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour? Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak.” He went away a second time and prayed, “My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done.”.
[Event 82] When he returned, he again found them sleeping, their eyes heavy. He left them and prayed the third time, saying the same thing. Returning a third time, he found them still asleep and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!”.
[Event 83] While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, accompanied by a large crowd armed with swords and clubs. This group had been sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people, and he had arranged a signal with them: “The one I kiss is the man; arrest him.” Approaching Jesus, Judas exclaimed, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed him. Jesus replied, “Friend, do what you came for.” Judas knew the location – he had often met there with Jesus and his disciples. A detachment of soldiers, accompanied by officials from the chief priests and Pharisees, arrived carrying torches, lanterns, and weapons, ready to arrest Jesus based on the signal he had established.
[Event 84] Knowing all that was going to happen to him, Jesus went out and asked them, “Who is it you want?” “Jesus of Nazareth,” they replied. “I am he,” Jesus said. And Judas the traitor was standing there with them. When Jesus declared, “I am he,” they drew back and fell to the ground. He again asked them, “Who is it you want?” And they responded, “Jesus of Nazareth.” Jesus then answered, “I told you that I am he.” He instructed them, “If you are looking for me, then let these men go.” This occurred so that the words he had spoken – “I have not lost one of those you gave me” – would be fulfilled.
[Event 85] Then the men seized Jesus and arrested him. One of those standing near, Simon Peter, drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.  As Peter acted, some of Jesus’ followers asked, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?” Jesus immediately rebuked Peter, saying, “No more of this!” He then touched Malchus’s ear and healed him. Jesus continued, “Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels? But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?”.
[Event 86] At that time, Jesus addressed the crowd, the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders who had come for him, and said, “Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me?” He continued, “Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour—when darkness reigns.” He explained that his presence in the temple courts, where he taught daily, was intended to fulfill the writings of the prophets.
[Event 87] Then all the disciples deserted him and fled. Then everyone deserted him and fled. The detachment of soldiers, along with its commander and the Jewish officials, arrested Jesus. They bound him.
[Event 88] A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When he was seized, he fled naked, leaving his linen garment behind.
[Event 89] Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled. They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, elders and teachers of the law came together. Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest.
[Event 90] Following his arrest, he was first brought to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. Caiaphas had advised the Jews that it would be good if one man died for the people.
[Event 91] Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus when Peter followed at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. Entering the courtyard, Peter sat down with the guards to warm himself at the fire. The other disciple, known to the high priest, went with Jesus into the courtyard, spoke to the girl on duty there, and brought Peter in to join them at the fire.
[Event 92] Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, where a servant girl approached him. “You also were with Jesus of Galilee,” she said. But he denied it before them all, stating, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”  He then went out to the gateway, where another girl saw him and said to the people gathered there, “This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth.”  

While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the high priest’s servant girls approached him. Looking closely at him, she said, “You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus.” He denied it, responding, “I don’t know or understand what you’re talking about.” 

The servants had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and were sitting down together. Peter sat down with them, warming himself by the firelight. A servant girl, observing him in the firelight, looked closely and said, “This man was with him.” He vehemently denied it, responding, “Woman, I don’t know him.” It was cold, and the servants and officials stood around the fire they had made to keep warm.
[Event 93] Please provide the source texts you want me to consolidate. I need the source texts to fulfill your request.
[Event 94] Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching. “I have spoken openly to the world,” Jesus replied. “I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret. Why question me? Ask those who heard me. Surely they know what I said.” When Jesus said this, one of the officials nearby, an unnamed official, struck him in the face. “Is this the way you answer the high priest?” he demanded. “If I said something wrong,” Jesus replied, “testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?” Then Annas sent him, still bound, to Caiaphas the high priest.
[Event 95] The chief priests and the entire Sanhedrin were actively seeking false evidence against Jesus, driven by their desire to bring about his death, but they consistently failed to uncover any genuine wrongdoing. Numerous individuals presented false testimonies, often contradictory in their claims. Specifically, two men stepped forward and declared, “This fellow said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.’” Another witness stated, “We heard him say, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.’” Despite these repeated false accusations, the high priest, standing before the assembled Sanhedrin, demanded an answer. “Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?” Jesus remained silent. The high priest, fueled by suspicion, further interrogated him, “I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.” Jesus responded, “Yes, it is as you say.” He then prophesied, “And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.”  At this, the high priest, consumed by outrage, tore his clothes and exclaimed, “He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think? He is worthy of death.”.
[Event 96] The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking him and beating him. They blindfolded him and repeatedly demanded, “Prophesy! Who hit you?” Others spat in his face, and some slapped him.  Alongside the physical assaults – including strikes with their fists – they said many other insulting things to him.
[Event 97] As Simon Peter stood warming himself, he was repeatedly questioned about his association with Jesus. Initially, when asked “You are not one of his disciples, are you?”, he denied it, stating “I am not.” Later, a servant girl observed him and declared, “This fellow is one of them.” Peter immediately denied this as well, uttering an oath: “I don’t know the man!” Shortly after, another individual saw Peter and insisted, “You also are one of them. Man, I am not!” Peter responded with a further denial, repeating “I am not.”.
[Event 98] After a little while, a group of individuals approached Peter and questioned him, stating, “Surely you are one of them, for your accent gives you away.” Peter immediately began to call down curses on himself and swore to them, “I don’t know the man!” Shortly after, another individual asserted, “Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean.” Peter, again denying any knowledge, replied, “Man, I don’t know what you’re talking about!”  A relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, a servant of the high priest, further challenged him, stating, “Didn’t I see you with him in the olive grove?” Peter responded with a denial, refusing to acknowledge any connection.
[Event 99] Immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed. And at that moment a rooster began to crow.
[Event 100] Immediately, a rooster crowed. Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: “Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.” The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then, recalling the Lord’s words, Peter went outside and wept bitterly.  He recalled the Lord’s instruction: “Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.”.
[Event 101] Very early in the morning, the chief priests, along with the elders, the teachers of the law, and the entire Sanhedrin council, came to the decision to put Jesus to death. They led Jesus before them, initiating a confrontation with questions. “If you are the Christ,” they said, “tell us.” Jesus responded, “If I tell you, you will not believe me, and if I asked you, you would not answer.” He then declared, “From now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God.” The council repeatedly pressed him with the question, “Are you then the Son of God?” Jesus affirmed, “You are right in saying I am.” Finally, they concluded, “Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from his own lips.”.
[Event 102] When Judas, who had betrayed Jesus, witnessed Jesus’s condemnation, he was overcome with remorse. He immediately returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders, confessing, “I have sinned, for I have betrayed innocent blood. What is that to us?” The chief priests responded, “That’s your responsibility.” Judas then threw the coins into the temple.  He subsequently departed and hanged himself.  Afterward, the chief priests retrieved the coins and declared, “It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money.” They then resolved to utilize the money to purchase the potter’s field as a burial place for foreigners. This action fulfilled the prophecy of Jeremiah the prophet, who had foretold, “They took the thirty silver coins, the price set on him by the people of Israel, and they used them to buy the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.”  Because of this event, the Field of Blood has remained a name for that land to this day.
[Event 103] They bound Jesus, leading him away and handing him over to Pilate, the Roman governor. The whole assembly rose and led him off to Pilate’s palace. As they approached, the Jews began to accuse him, stating, “We have found this man subverting our nation. He opposes payment of taxes to Caesar and claims to be Christ, a king.” By now it was early morning, and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness, the Jews did not enter the palace; they wanted to be able to eat the Passover. Pilate came out to them and asked, “What charges are you bringing against this man?” “If he were not a criminal,” they replied, “we would not have handed him over to you.” Pilate said, “Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.” “But we have no right to execute anyone,” the Jews objected. This occurred so that the words Jesus had spoken indicating the kind of death he was going to die would be fulfilled. They had taken him from Caiaphas to the palace.
[Event 104] Meanwhile, Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” “Yes, it is as you say,” Jesus replied. As the chief priests and elders accused him, Jesus gave no answer. The governor, observing this, again asked, “Aren’t you going to answer? See how many things they are accusing you of.” Jesus remained silent, to the great amazement of the governor. 

Pilate then questioned Jesus directly, “Are you the king of the Jews?” Jesus responded with a pointed question, “Is that your own idea, or did others talk to you about me?” Pilate, in turn, asked, “Am I a Jew?” Jesus replied, “You are right in saying I am a king. In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.” 

Pilate, having found no basis for a charge against Jesus, announced this to the chief priests and the crowd. He then returned to the palace and, confronting Jesus again, asked, “Are you the king of the Jews?” Jesus responded, “My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jews. But now my kingdom is from another place.” Pilate, acknowledging Jesus’s claim, asked, “What is truth?”.
[Event 105] But they insisted, “He stirs up the people all over Judea by his teaching. He started in Galilee and has come all the way here.” Upon hearing this, Pilate inquired if the man was a Galilean. Learning that Jesus was under Herod’s jurisdiction, and that Herod was himself in Jerusalem at that time, Pilate sent Jesus to Herod. When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased; for a long time he had been wanting to see him. Having heard accounts of Jesus, Herod hoped to see him perform a miracle. He plied Jesus with many questions, but Jesus gave him no answer. The chief priests and the teachers of the law stood nearby, vehemently accusing him. Then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked Jesus. Dressing him in an elegant robe, Herod sent Jesus back to Pilate. That day, a friendship developed between Herod and Pilate, a relationship that had previously been marked by enmity.
[Event 106] While Pilate was sitting on the judge’s seat, his wife sent him a message: “Don’t have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him.”.
[Event 107] Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people, and stated to them, “You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and have found no basis for your charges against him. Furthermore, Herod examined him as well, and having sent him back to us, he has done nothing to deserve death.”.
[Event 108] Now it was the governor’s custom at the Feast to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd. A man called Barabbas was in prison; he was among the insurrectionists who had committed murder during the uprising. When the crowd had gathered, the governor, Pilate, asked them, “Do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?” He knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him. Pilate specifically inquired, “Do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?” It was a standard practice, and he was aware the crowd’s request stemmed from envy.
[Event 109] But the chief priests, along with the elders, stirred up the crowd to persuade Pontius Pilate to release Barabbas instead of Jesus. “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” asked the governor. With one voice, the crowd answered, “Barabbas!” Barabbas had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city, and for murder. The chief priests continued to pressure the crowd, urging them to demand Barabbas’ release.
[Event 110] “What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called Christ?” Pilate asked. He inquired, “Why? What crime has he committed?” But the crowd shouted all the louder, “Crucify him!” Pilate appealed to them again, wanting to release Jesus, but they continued to insist, “Crucify him! Crucify him!” For the third time, Pilate spoke to them, asking why they demanded his crucifixion, explaining that he had found no grounds for the death penalty. Despite his efforts, their shouts prevailed, and they continued to demand that Jesus be crucified.
[Event 111] Then, the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him. They put a purple robe on him and twisted together a crown of thorns, setting it on his head. Falling to their knees, they paid homage to him, repeatedly shouting, “Hail, king of the Jews!” The soldiers struck him in the face again and again with a staff, and they spat on him. Pilate had previously flogged Jesus.
[Event 112] On the day of Preparation of Passover Week, about the sixth hour – the Gabbatha, also known as the Stone Pavement in Aramaic – Pilate brought Jesus out for a second time before the assembled Jews. Initially, Pilate stated, “Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him.” Jesus appeared wearing the crown of thorns and a purple robe. However, as soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they immediately shouted, “Crucify! Crucify!” 

Despite their continued insistence, Pilate remained firm, repeating, “You take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him.” The Jews, driven by their conviction that Jesus’s claim to be the Son of God warranted his death according to their law, relentlessly demanded his crucifixion. 

Pilate, increasingly apprehensive, retreated back into the palace and questioned Jesus, “Where do you come from?” but Jesus offered no response. He then confronted them directly, “Do you refuse to speak to me?” 

The chief priests and officials continued to pressure him, arguing, “You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.” 

Despite this, Pilate attempted to release Jesus, but the crowd’s fervent cries persisted: “If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar.” 

Finally, Pilate, yielding to the overwhelming pressure, brought Jesus back out before the crowd and sat down on the Gabbatha. He declared, “Here is your king,” but the Jews responded, “Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him! Shall I crucify your king?” Pilate, acknowledging their unwavering stance, conceded, “We have no king but Caesar.”.
[Event 113] When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. “I am innocent of this man’s blood,” he said. “It is your responsibility!” All the people answered, “Let his blood be on us and on our children!”.
[Event 114] Finally, Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified. Wanting to satisfy the crowd, he released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged, and he surrendered Jesus to their will. So Pilate decided to grant their demand, releasing the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for.
[Event 115] After they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him. Then, carrying his own cross, the soldiers took charge of Jesus and led him out to the place of the Skull – which in Aramaic is called Golgotha – to crucify him.
[Event 116] As they were going out, they seized Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country. Simon was the father of Alexander and Rufus. They forced him to carry the cross behind Jesus.
[Event 117] A large number of people followed Jesus, including women who mourned and wailed for him. He turned and addressed them, saying, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep for yourselves and for your children. For the time will come when you will say, 'Blessed are the barren women, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!' Then they will say to the mountains, “Fall on us!” and to the hills, “Cover us!” For if men do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?”.
[Event 118] They came to a place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull). There, they crucified Jesus along with two other criminals—one on his right and the other on his left. They offered him wine mixed with gall, but after tasting it, he refused to drink it. Following the crucifixion, they divided up his clothes by casting lots.
[Event 119] Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”.
[Event 120] When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they divided up his clothes by casting lots. They took his clothes and divided them into four shares, one for each of the soldiers. The undergarment, which was seamless and woven in one piece from top to bottom, was also to be divided by lot. “Let’s not tear it,” they said to one another. They kept watch over him while this occurred.
[Event 121] It was the third hour when he was crucified.
[Event 122] Above Jesus’ head, a written notice was affixed to the cross. The wording of the notice varied slightly, but consistently stated: “THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.”  The chief priests of the Jews vehemently protested, urging Pilate not to include the phrase, arguing that Jesus himself had claimed the title. They insisted that the sign should simply read “Jesus of Nazareth.” However, Pilate, having already prepared and fastened the notice, responded firmly, “What I have written, I have written.”  Notably, the sign was written in three languages – Aramaic, Latin, and Greek – to maximize its visibility, as the location of the crucifixion was near the city. Many Jews were able to read the sign due to its multilingual inscription.
[Event 123] Two other men, both criminals, were led out to be executed alongside him. Two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
[Event 124] As Jesus hung on the cross, those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads. Some cried out, “So! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, come down from the cross and save yourself!” Others, including the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders, mocked him among themselves. They repeatedly stated, “He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen One.” The people stood watching, and the rulers even sneered at him.  The crucified robbers also heaped insults on him, echoing the accusations: “He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen One.”.
[Event 125] The soldiers came up and mocked him, offering him wine vinegar and saying, “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.”.
[Event 126] One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at Jesus, shouting, “Aren’t you the Christ? Save yourself and us!” But the other criminal rebuked him. “Don’t you fear God,” he said, “since you are under the same sentence? We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve.” Then he turned to Jesus and said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.” Jesus answered him, “I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise.”.
[Event 127] Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, Mary, along with Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary Magdalene. As Jesus approached, he said to his mother, “Dear woman, here is your son,” and to the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said, “Here is your mother.” From that time on, this disciple took Mary into his home.
[Event 128] It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land. This darkness persisted until the ninth hour, and the sun stopped shining.
[Event 129] At the ninth hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?”—which translates to “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” Some of those standing there heard this and said, “Listen, he’s calling Elijah.”.
[Event 130] Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, putting it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink. Later, knowing that all was now completed, and so that the Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, “I am thirsty.” A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus’ lips.
[Event 131] “Now leave him alone. Let’s see if Elijah comes to take him down,” he said.
[Event 132] When he had received the drink, Jesus said, “It is finished.”.
[Event 133] Jesus called out with a loud voice, “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.”.
[Event 134] When Jesus had said this, he breathed his last with a loud cry. He then bowed his head and gave up his spirit.
[Event 135] At that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rocks split. Tombs broke open, and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. These resurrected individuals emerged from the tombs and, after Jesus’ resurrection, appeared to many people in the holy city.
[Event 136] When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified. The centurion, standing there in front of Jesus, heard his cry and saw how he died. He exclaimed, “Surely he was the Son of God!”  Upon witnessing the event, the centurion praised God and said, “Surely this was a righteous man.”.
[Event 137] When all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place, they beat their breasts and went away.
[Event 138] Many women stood at a distance, watching these things. These women had followed Jesus from Galilee, caring for his needs. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons. Salome was also present. Furthermore, many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were observing from afar, including those who had followed him from Galilee.
[Event 139] Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jews did not want the bodies of those crucified, including Jesus, left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have their legs broken and the bodies taken down. The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other. However, when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus’ side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water. The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true; he knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe. These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: “Not one of his bones will be broken,” and, as another scripture says, “They will look on the one they have pierced.”.
[Event 140] As evening approached on Preparation Day, a man named Joseph, a member of the Council and a good, upright individual from the Judean town of Arimathea, came forward. Joseph had not consented to the Council’s decision and action, and he was waiting for the kingdom of God. He approached Pontius Pilate and, seeking Jesus’ body, requested it be given to him. Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, though he did so secretly due to his fear of the Jews. Pilate was surprised to learn that Jesus was already dead, and he summoned a centurion to confirm the information. The centurion confirmed that Jesus had indeed died, and upon this confirmation, Pilate granted Joseph permission to take the body away.
[Event 141] It was the Jewish Day of Preparation, and as the Sabbath was about to begin, Joseph, accompanied by Nicodemus – the man who had previously visited Jesus at night – took down Jesus’ body from the place where it had been crucified, a garden containing a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid.  They proceeded to the tomb, which had been cut out of the rock, and, in accordance with Jewish burial customs, wrapped the body in strips of linen, incorporating approximately seventy-five pounds of myrrh and aloes brought by Nicodemus. Joseph then rolled a large stone in front of the tomb’s entrance, securing the body within. This new tomb was situated in a cave cut out of the rock.
[Event 142] Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where Jesus had been laid. The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how his body was laid within it.
[Event 143] They went home and prepared spices and perfumes, but they rested on the Sabbath in obedience to the commandment.
[Event 144] The next day, following Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate. “Sir,” they said, “we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, ‘After three days I will rise again.’ So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first.” Pilate answered, “Take a guard; go, make the tomb as secure as you know how.” They went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.
[Event 145] When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus’ body.
[Event 146] Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb. Upon arriving, she found that the stone had been rolled away from the entrance. Shortly after, at dawn, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb. As they were on their way, they asked each other, “Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb?” The women had taken the spices they had prepared.
[Event 147] There was a violent earthquake. An angel of the Lord descended from heaven and went to the tomb. He rolled back the stone and sat upon it. His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. The guards, overcome with fear, shook and became like dead men.
[Event 148] When they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled away from the tomb.
[Event 149] When they entered the room following the crucifixion of Jesus, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
[Event 150] As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed. Simultaneously, while they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them.
[Event 151] In their fright, the women bowed down with their faces to the ground. The angel reassured them, saying, “Don’t be afraid, for you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. He is not here; he has risen, just as he said.” The men instructed them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here; he has risen!” The angel then directed them to the place where they had laid him, urging them to come and see.
[Event 152] Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: “The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.” Then they remembered his words.
[Event 153] “Now I have told you: go quickly and tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.’”.
[Event 154] Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.
[Event 155] The women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy.
[Event 156] So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved.
[Event 157] “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put him!”.
[Event 158] So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb. The other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in. Simultaneously, Simon Peter, who was behind him, arrived and went into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there, as well as the burial cloth that had been folded up by itself, separate from the linen, which had been around Jesus’ head. At that moment, the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside and saw and believed. They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead. Then the disciples went back to their homes.
[Event 159] When Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, he first appeared to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons. Mary Magdalene was weeping outside the tomb when she saw two angels in white seated at the foot and head of Jesus’s former body. She asked, “Why are you crying?” and explained that her Lord had been taken away, and she did not know where he was. Turning around, she saw Jesus standing there, but mistook him for the gardener, saying, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will get him.” Jesus responded, “Mary.” She recognized him as “Rabboni!” (which means Teacher) and he instructed her not to hold on to him, explaining that he hadn’t yet returned to the Father. He then told her to go to her brothers and tell them, “I am returning to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.”.
[Event 160] And Jesus, having run to tell his disciples, suddenly met them. “Greetings,” he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him. Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.”.
[Event 161] While the women were on their way, some of the guards entered the city and reported everything that had happened to the chief priests. Upon meeting with the elders, the chief priests devised a plan and gave the soldiers a large sum of money, instructing them to report that Jesus’s disciples had stolen him away during the night while the witnesses were asleep. They further stated that if this fabricated account reached the governor, they would be cleared of trouble. The soldiers accepted the money and followed these instructions, and this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day.
[Event 162] Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: “I have seen the Lord!” She told them that he had said these things to her. Upon returning from the tomb, she and the other women – including Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others who had been with Jesus and were mourning and weeping – told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others. When they heard that Jesus was alive and that Mary Magdalene had seen him, they did not believe it; their words seemed to them like nonsense.
[Event 163] According to Peter, “It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.”.
[Event 164] Afterward, Jesus appeared in a different form to two of the disciples while they were walking in the country. That same day, two of the disciples were traveling to the village of Emmaus, approximately seven miles from Jerusalem. They were engaged in a discussion about everything that had happened, including the events surrounding Jesus’ arrest and trial. As they walked, Jesus himself came up and walked alongside them, but they were unable to recognize him. He inquired, “What are you discussing together as you walk along?” The two men, their faces downcast, stopped walking. One of them, named Cleopas, questioned him, “Are you only a visitor to Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these days?” Jesus asked, “What things?” They replied, “About Jesus of Nazareth. He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people. The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him; but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel.” It was the third day since these events transpired. Furthermore, some of their women had gone to the tomb early that morning and hadn’t found his body. They had reported seeing a vision of angels who had declared that he was alive. Then, some of the disciples themselves went to the tomb and found it as the women had described, but they did not see Jesus himself. Jesus then began to explain to them, beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself, saying, “How foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?”.
[Event 165] As they approached the village they were headed to, Jesus acted as if he were continuing onward. However, his disciples urged him strongly to stay with them, stating, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.” Jesus then entered to stay with them. At the table, he took bread, gave thanks for it, broke it, and began to give it to his disciples. As he did so, their eyes were opened and they recognized him. Immediately after recognizing him, he disappeared from their sight. Afterwards, they questioned each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?”.
[Event 166] Those who had returned reported the event to the others, but they did not believe them.  Those who had returned went back to Jerusalem and found the Eleven and those with them assembled together. They were saying, “It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.” Then the two recounted what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread.
[Event 167] On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus appeared to them. He rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after his resurrection. He said, “Peace be with you!” After he said this, Jesus stood among them and showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord. He asked them, “Do you have anything here to eat?” They gave him a piece of broiled fish, and he took it and ate it in their presence. He further explained, “Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.” Despite this, the disciples were still troubled and filled with doubts, though their initial reaction was one of joy and amazement.
[Event 168] Again, Jesus said, “Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.” He then breathed on them and declared, “Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven.”.
[Event 169] He spoke to them, saying, “This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.” He then opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. He explained, “This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things.”.
