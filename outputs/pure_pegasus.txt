"If you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done" "John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did" "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things," says Jesus. "If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer"
